## Introduction
Hello there ðŸ‘‹! Want some inspiration on how an interactive form might look like
in the context of a delivery service? Then look no further! This angular project
is the perfect example for how minimalism and interactiveness can combine to create a
quick and flawless user experience.

## What it delivers
* A toolbar and a footer component
* Interactive form components for choosing food
* A component for displaying a choice of 3 items
* Pages for choosing a burger, a pizza or a pasta
* Simple integration for APIs with services
